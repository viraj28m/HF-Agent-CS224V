      "message": "Hi, thanks for checking in. Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling a little better this week. I still get mild shortness of breath if I\u2019m moving around a lot, and I feel a bit tired when doing chores, but it\u2019s not as bad as it used to be. I\u2019ve noticed occasional swelling in my legs, but it\u2019s not every day. Sleeping flat hasn\u2019t really been a problem lately. Is this kind of improvement normal, or should I expect more change soon?"
